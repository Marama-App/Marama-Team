# Marama-Team
We created [Mārama](http://marama.org.nz) as part of our final project while studying at Enspiral Dev Academy. This idea was based on the vision Stina Muller had for a platform that encorporated study options based on student interest and how those students could fund their way there. 

Read more about what her vision is, in the [Mārama repository](https://github.com/Marama-App/marama).
